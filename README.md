# Professional-README-Generator



 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 9 Challenge, Node.js: Professional README Generator.

- The purpose of this challenge was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package Links to an external site.. Review the Professional README Guide Links to an external site.as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

- When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

- You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.


- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

Because this application won’t be deployed, i will also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. 

- Revisit 2.2.4: Screencastify Tutorial in Module 2 of the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

 ## Installation

  - To install this code, download the zip file, or use GitHub's guidelines to clone the repository.

  - In order to install inquirer, i used npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

  - The application will be invoked by using the following command: 'node index.js'.


## Usage

  - Some of the technologies i used in this course (GraphQL and MERN) don't work well with Node.js v18, so i used Node.js v16. 
  
  - I follow the instructions outlined in the Node Installation Guide on the Full-Stack Blog Links to an external site. to ensure that i'm using Node.js v18. Once these problems have been resolved in the future, i will be able to use Node.js v18 as runtime environment.

  -  Revisit 2.2.4: Screencastify Tutorial in Module 2 of the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer.

  - Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!


## User Story

- AS A developer
- I WANT a README generator
- SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project


## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
- THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
- WHEN I enter my project title
- THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
- THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
- THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- WHEN I enter my GitHub username
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- WHEN I enter my email address
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
- WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
- THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

 ## Contribute 

 -  Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.

- Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

- Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

- Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

- Refer to the Video Submission Guide Links to an external site.on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.
